# Minutes_of_Meeting_ChatBot
This app is a Gradio-based AI tool that serves two purposes. It features a chatbot that uses a local Llama 3.2 model to provide real-time, streaming conversations. Additionally, it transcribes audio with a Whisper model and then summarizes the transcript into meeting minutes, providing a smooth user experience by showing progress updates.
